		<h2>Why Ad-Block?</h2>
		<hr/>
		<div class="sixteen columns">
			<div class="one-third column alpha">
				<h3>Speed</h3>
				<p>Adverts can be very resource-heavy; especially on slower computers. Many adverts take advantage of technologies such as Adobe Flash which can use large amounts of memory and CPU-time.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="one-third column">
				<h3>Privacy</h3>
				<p>Many adverts inject tracking cookies into your browser and are used to track your internet usage and tailor adverts to what you've been browsing. E.g. if you recently browsed a lot of laptop review sites, you'd get adverts advertising laptop deals. These can be useful but also infringe on your privacy.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="one-third column omega">
				<h3>Annoyance</h3>
				<p>Many adverts can be extremely annoying. They look out of place on websites, can break the template/structure of a website. Some websites make you watch or interact with them before you can view the main content. Monetized YouTube videos for example require you to watch adverts before you can watch a video, and then have adverts on-top of the video while you're watching which can distract from the main video.</p>

						Google Chrome makes it really easy to install an ad-blocker. We recommend µBlock (That's pronounced micro-block).
						<br/>To install, just click the '+ Free' button on the Chrome Webstore page linked to by the button below. Chrome will pop-up asking you to confirm permissions. Just click confirm/add and browse like normal. No restart required!

					It's possible your browser does not have a compatible ad-blocking solution. If you know how, you could always try using an ad-blocking hosts file as an alternative. We recommend the <a href="http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm">MVPS Hosts File</a>.
					<br/>This is not recommended for the the average user however.

			<div class="sixteen column">
				<p>While ad-blockers can make your user experience much better, it also strips your favourite sites from their revenue. Some sites and their content are wholly
					funded by advertisements. <br/>
				If you find a site and you like it, and it doesn't have obtrusive advertisements (For example, Reddit), unblock the adverts!
