		<h2>Why Adblock?</h2>
		<hr/>
		<div class="sixteen columns">
			<div class="one-third column alpha">
				<h3>Speed</h3>
				<p>Adverts can be very resource-heavy; especially on slower computers. Many adverts take advantage of technologies such as Adobe Flash which can
				use large amounts of memory and CPU-time.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="one-third column">
				<h3>Privacy</h3>
				<p>Many adverts inject tracking cookies into your browser and are used to track your internet usage and tailor adverts to what you've been
				browsing. E.g. if you recently browsed a lot of laptop review sites, you'd get adverts advertising laptop deals. These can be useful but also
				infringe on your privacy.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="one-third column omega">
				<h3>Annoyance</h3>
				<p>Many adverts can be extremely annoying. They look out of place on websites, can break the template/structure of a website. Some websites make you watch or 
				interact with them before you can view the main content. Monetized YouTube videos for example require you to watch adverts before you can watch a video,
				and then have adverts on-top of the video while you're watching which can distract from the main video.</p>

		<h2>Get started - Choose your desktop browser...</h2>

		<div class="sixteen columns">
			<div class="one-third column alpha">
				<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
				<p class="browserimg">
					<img src="img/browsers/google-chrome.png" />
					<p>
						Google Chrome makes it really easy to install an ad-blocker. We recommend µBlock (That's pronounced micro-block).
						<br/>To install, just click the '+ Free' button on the Chrome Webstore page linked to by the button below. Chrome will pop-up asking you to confirm permissions. Just click confirm/add and browse like normal. No restart required!
					</p>
					<a class="button" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/µblock/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">Download µBlock For Google Chrome</a>

			<div class="one-third column">
				<h3>Mozilla Firefox</h3>
				<p class="browserimg">
					<img src="img/browsers/firefox.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Firefox makes it really easy to install an ad-blocker. We recommend 'Adblock Edge', which is a copy of 'Adblock Plus' without an 'unobtrusive advert' whitelist.
					<br/>To install, just click Download on the Firefox Addons website linked to by the button below. A popup window will show asking you to confirm. Confirm and just continue browsing as normal - no restart required!
				</p>

				<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>
				<p class="browserimg">
					<img src="img/browsers/internet-explorer.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Internet Explorer's add-on functionality isn't as seamless as other browsers; however it's still very easy to install an ad-blocker. We recommend 'Adblock Plus'.
					<br/>To install, just run their set-up tool from the official website linked to by the button below and enable it when you relaunch your browser - you'll be asked to automatically.
				</p>

				<h3>Opera</h3>
				<p class="browserimg">
					<img src="img/browsers/opera.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Opera makes it really easy to install an ad-blocker. We recommend µBlock (That's pronounced micro-block).
					<br/>To install, just click the 'Install' button on the Opera add-ons page linked by the button below, wait for the button to turn green and continue browsing as normal - no restart required!

				</p>
				<p>
					Safari makes it really easy to install an ad-blocker. We recommend 'Adblock Plus'.
					<br/>To install, just click the install button on the Apple Safari Extensions page below. Wait for the install to complete and continue browsing as normal - no restart required!
				</p>
				<a class="button" href="https://extensions.apple.com/details/?id=org.adblockplus.adblockplussafari-GRYYZR985A">Download Adblock Plus for Safari</a>

				<h3>Not Listed Here?</h3>
				<p class="browserimg">
					<img src="img/browsers/none.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					It's possible your browser does not have a compatible ad-blocking solution. If you know how, you could always try using an ad-blocking hosts file as an alternative. We recommend the <a href="http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm">MVPS Hosts File</a>.
					<br/>This is not recommended for the the average user however.
